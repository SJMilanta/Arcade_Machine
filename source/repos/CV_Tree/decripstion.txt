The app is designed to compare genes and decide which are alike and which are different. Genes are DNA that get transcribed into proteins. A protein consists of a sequence of amino acids. There are 20 commonly occurring amino acids. There 20 amino acids are typically represented via letters of the alphabet: ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV (http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/educ.../AminoAcid/the_twenty.html). A protein sequence (or gene can therefore be represented in an ASCII text file (such as data/AcMNPV.faa) as a sequence of these letters. A gene may consist of hundreds or thousands of amino acids. For analysis we break those long sequences into shorter sequences (much like we break sentences up into words). These shorter sequences, called k-mers are of fixed length and contain k amino acids. In our app, the longest k-mer that we look at is k=6 (or LEN), otherwise known as 6-mers. But we also consider k-mers of length 4 (LEN-2) and 5 (LEN-1). AA_NUMBER is the size of the alphabet, i.e. the number of different amino acids. Genes are compared by comparing the relative frequency of all of the different k-mers. If Gene A has roughly the same proportion of a particular k-mer as Gene B, then they are more likely to be similar overall.
